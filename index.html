      <b>a Short intro about myself - </b>Hi! Thanks for visiting my page! smileyface
      My name is Riaan, and I grew up in the small town south of South Africa, called Hermanus.
      After Highschool I completed my Diploma in Civil Engineering, with a post grad degree in Construction Management.
      I then worked for a construction company all over South Africa for a couple of years.

        <h2>My work experience</h2>
        <p>
        From shoveling dirt in the trenches, designing pipe fittings to attending monthly cost meetings - 
        I have been blessed with the opportunity to explore Civil Engineering Construction from all aspects over the past 10 Years. 
        What the past 10 years have taught me is that as soon as you think you know everything, 
        you soon find yourself in a situation you have never encountered before. 
        <br>
        <br>
        It is this endless learning aspect in Civil Engineering that I enjoyed.

        <p>
        Moving with the Times. I have since ended my journey in the construction industry
        <br>as I decided to test my abilities and explore what I feel is one of the most intimidating and  
        <br>talked about industries currently, the tech industry.
